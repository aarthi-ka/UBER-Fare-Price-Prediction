# UBER-Fare-Price-Prediction
The project is about on world's largest taxi company Uber inc. In this project, we're looking to predict the fare for their future transactional cases. Uber delivers service to lakhs of customers daily. Now it becomes really important to manage their data properly to come up with new business ideas to get best results. 
Eventually, it becomes really important to estimate the fare prices accurately.

The datset contains the following fields:
key - a unique identifier for each trip
fare_amount - the cost of each trip in usd
pickup_datetime - date and time when the meter was engaged
passenger_count - the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)
pickup_longitude - the longitude where the meter was engaged
pickup_latitude - the latitude where the meter was engaged
dropoff_longitude - the longitude where the meter was disengaged
dropoff_latitude - the latitude where the meter was disengaged

The dataset is referred from Kaggle.
The Machine Learning Algorithm which we used here to train models are Linear Regression, Random Forest Algorithm, Decision Tree Algorithm and XGBoost. And the libraries we used to clean the dataset are pandas, numpy , matplotlib and  seaborn.  By using these Algorithms we trained our model to make good Results. Finally We got the desired accuracy from the XGBoost Algorithm . so we concluded this project by the accuracy from R squared value of XGBoost Algorithm.
